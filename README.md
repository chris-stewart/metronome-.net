Drummer metronome proof of concept in C#.

This project is a quick concept program done in preparation for being ported to android. It allows the user to layout a full song for a metronome, with shifting tempos and time signatures, for something quick and easy to practice along to. There actually aren't any apps on the market right now that do this, so it's a custom thing for myself mostly.
